Implement the primal affine scaling algorithm, using a high-level language such as Matlab
or Octave. Test the code using a set of linear optimization problems.

The input parameters to the code will be the cost vector c, the constraints matrix A,
and the right-hand-side vector b.  The constraints matrix A will have to be expanded with a new
variable needed by the Big-M method.

This assignment has to be done individually or in groups of two.
You have to provide a compressed file (zip, rar or tgz) with the Matlab/Octave code, and a
report (in pdf format) describing the characteristics of the linear problems tested
(number of variables, constraints, and nonzero coefficients of the constrainst matrix),
the results obtained (number of iterations, optimal objective value found) with your code
and some standard code (such as Matlab's "linprog"). Comment those aspects you consider
relevant to your code. In particular, comment on how the M value of the Big-M method is
computed. Check the behaviour of the code when no scaling is considered, that is, when the
scaling matrix is the identity. Does the algorithm work?


You can test your code with Netlib problems obtained with the MPS to Matlab converter,
or directly by dowloading Matlab versions of these problems from
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/LPnetlib/index.html .
